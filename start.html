    <h1><b>Racial Standards</b></h1>  

    <p><i>Race does not biologically exist, yet how we identify with race is so powerful, it influences our experiences and shapes our lives. In a society that privileges white people and whiteness, racist ideas are considered normal throughout our media, culture, social systems, and institutions. Historically, racist views justified the unfair treatment and oppression of people of color.
        In some countries, there is now broader acknowledgment of the systemic nature of the racism that affects the lives of Africans and people of African descent. There is also wider acceptance of the need to address the past in order to secure future conditions of life that uphold the dignity and rights of all. It is our collective duty to address these issues immediately and everywhere. 
        
        Individual racism refers to the beliefs, attitudes, and actions of individuals that support or perpetuate racism in conscious and unconscious ways. The U.S. cultural narrative about racism typically focuses on individual racism and fails to recognize systemic racism.
    
        Structural racism is the overarching system of racial bias across institutions and society. These systems give privileges to white people resulting in disadvantages to people of color.
    
        Institutional racism occurs in an organization. These are discriminatory treatments, unfair policies, or biased practices based on race that result in inequitable outcomes for whites over people of color and extend considerably beyond prejudice. These institutional policies often never mention any racial group, but the intent is to create advantages.
